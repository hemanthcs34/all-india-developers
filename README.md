## The Problem

Have you ever been frustrated by false alerts on Google Maps? Or felt bored staring at a static map, unsure of what's happening around you? Have you ever wished you knew about important or fun events nearby, but just didn‚Äôt know where to look?

Ushe-Nav was born from these frustrations. We believe that city navigation should be dynamic, reliable, and community-driven.

## What is Ushe-Nav?

**Ushe-Nav** is a full-stack web application that transforms your map into a live, interactive hub for real, local events. It's a user-powered platform where you can discover and share what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîwhether it's a üöß roadblock, a ‚òî weather update, or a üé≠ local festival.

Our mission is to create a trustworthy, engaging, and truly local information ecosystem for every city.

## ‚ú® Core Features

Ushe-Nav is packed with features designed to create a reliable and exciting user experience.

### 1. Dual-Layered Validation System

To combat misinformation, every post goes through a robust two-tiered validation process:

-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Verification:** Every uploaded image is analyzed by **Clarifai's AI**. The post is only accepted if the AI's visual analysis matches the user-selected category. No more pictures of cats for a roadblock alert!
-   **üë• Community-Powered Validation:** For non-visual alerts like power outages, the system automatically prompts other users within a 1km radius to confirm the event's authenticity with a simple thumbs up/down vote.

### 2. Ushe-Gram: The Gamified Social Feed

We've made civic engagement rewarding and fun!

-   **Social Feed:** All validated alerts appear in **Ushe-Gram**, an integrated social media-style feed where users can interact with posts.
-   **Likes & Comments:** Users can like and comment on posts, fostering community discussion.
-   **Points & Leaderboard:** Users earn points for posting, validating, and receiving engagement. A real-time leaderboard showcases the top contributors.
-   **Incentives:** Our model includes monthly incentives (coupons, goodies) from sponsors for the top performers on the leaderboard, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.

### 3. Powerful Map & User Experience

-   **Hyperlocal Focus:** The map is centered on your location, showing only relevant events within a 1km radius.
-   **Customizable Filters:** Easily filter map markers by category to see only the alerts you care about.
-   **Secure Authentication:** A complete login and signup system protects user accounts and data.
